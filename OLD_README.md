## Notes

todo:

* (check, is this still an issue?) `array<A::B>`, or `namespace A { auto x = {B()}; class B {} }` accessing x from outside A
  * types don't resolve right
  * seems limited to when constructors don't exist, mb? (nah, auto still doesn't resolve right)
  * `ResolveAutos` in `as_parser.ts`?
* preprocessor support for `TMNEXT | MP4 | TURBO` -- will mean that we don't have to avoid that one VehicleState file
* better argument handling for settings
* settings highlighting
* suggest likely casts for nadeo types
* add list of superclasses (inherited by) to docs for classes
* inside inline function definitions don't work right, but don't throw errors at least

## Features
### Editor Connection
The unreal-angelscript extension automatically makes a connection to the
running Unreal Editor instance for most of its functionality. If the editor
is not running, certain features will not be available.

### Code Completion
The extension will try to complete your angelscript code as you type it
using normal visual studio code language server features.

### Error Display
When saving a file the unreal editor automatically compiles and reloads it,
sending any errors to the visual code extension. Errors will be highlighted
in the code display and in the problems window.

### Debugging
You can start debugging from the Debug sidebar or by pressing F5. While
debug mode is active, breakpoints can be set in angelscript files and
the unreal editor will automatically break and stop execution when
they are reached.

Hitting 'Stop' on the debug toolbar will not close the unreal editor,
it merely stops the debug connection, causing breakpoints to be ignored.

When the debug connection is active, any exceptions that occur during
angelscript execution will automatically cause the editor and visual
studio code to pause execution and show the exception.

### Go to Symbol
The default visual studio code 'Go to Definition' (F12) is implemented for
angelscript symbols. A separate command is added to the right click menu
(default shortcut: Alt+G), named 'Go to Symbol'. This command functions
identically to 'Go to Definition' for angelscript symbols.

If you have the Unreal Editor open as well as Visual Studio proper showing
the C++ source code for unreal, the extension will try to use its
unreal editor connection to browse your Visual Studio to the right place,
similar to double clicking a C++ class or function in blueprints.

This uses the standard unreal source navigation system, which is only
implemented for classes and functions.

### Add Import To
The 'Add Import To' (default shortcut: Shift+Alt+I) command from the
right click menu will try to automatically add an import statement
to the top of the file to import the type that the command was run on.

### Quick Open Import
The 'Quick Open Import' (default shortcut: Ctrl+E or Ctrl+P) command from the
right click menu will try to open the quick open navigation with the import
statement.

### More Language Features
This extension acts as a full language server for angelscript code. This includes
semantic highlighting, signature help, reference search, rename symbol and a number
of helpful code actions and quickfixes.

Some of these features require an active connection to the unreal editor.

### Semantic Symbol Colors
There are more types of semantic symbols generated by the extension than there
are colors specified by most color themes.

The default visual studio code color theme will display all variables in blue,
for example, regardless of whether the variable is a member, parameter or local.

You can add a snippet to your `.vscode/settings.json` inside your project folder
to add extra colors to make these differences more visible.

For example, to add extra colors to the default vscode dark theme:

```
    "editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
		"[Default Dark+]": {
			"textMateRules": [
				{
					"scope": "support.type.component.angelscript",
					"settings": {
						"foreground": "#4ec962"
					}
				},
				{
					"scope": "support.type.actor.angelscript",
					"settings": {
						"foreground": "#2eb0c9"
					}
				},
				{
					"scope": "variable.parameter.angelscript",
					"settings": {
						"foreground": "#ffe5d9"
					}
				},
				{
					"scope": "variable.other.local.angelscript",
					"settings": {
						"foreground": "#e8ffed"
					}
				},
				{
					"scope": "variable.other.global.angelscript",
					"settings": {
						"foreground": "#b99cfe"
					}
				},
				{
					"scope": "variable.other.global.accessor.angelscript",
					"settings": {
						"foreground": "#b99cfe"
					}
				},
				{
					"scope": "entity.name.function.angelscript",
					"settings": {
						"foreground": "#b99cfe"
					}
				},
				{
					"scope": "invalid.unimported.angelscript",
					"settings": {
						"foreground": "#ff9000"
					}
				},
			]
		}
	}
```
